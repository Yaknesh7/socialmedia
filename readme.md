Social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks
Social media is about conversations, community, connecting with the audience and building relationships. It is not just a broadcast channel or a sales and marketing tool.
Authenticity, honesty and open dialogue are key.

Be compelling, useful, relevant and engaging. Donâ€™t be afraid to try new things, but think through your efforts before kicking them off.

Blogs: A platform for casual dialogue and discussions on a specific topic or opinion.
